# Implementation Plan: Telescope Integration with Smart Caching

**Branch**: `002-telescope-cache-integration` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-telescope-cache-integration/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The plugin integrates with GitHub to find repo/release information for actions used in GitHub workflow files, activating only for `.github/workflows/*.yaml|yml` files. It uses a cache-first approach to reduce latency and minimize GitHub API calls by 90%, exposing commands for version selection via Telescope picker and cache management including `:GhActionsCachePurge`. The implementation uses Lua 5.1+ with plenary.nvim and telescope.nvim, leveraging GitHub CLI for authentication and API access. The design follows constitution principles with comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and user experience consistency.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Lua 5.1+ (Neovim compatibility)  
**Primary Dependencies**: plenary.nvim, telescope.nvim, GitHub CLI (gh)  
**Storage**: Local JSON cache files in `vim.fn.stdpath('cache')/ghactions.nvim/`  
**Testing**: plenary.nvim test framework  
**Target Platform**: Neovim 0.7.0+ on Linux/macOS/Windows  
**Project Type**: Single Neovim plugin  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms picker response, <100ms preview updates, ≥90% cache hit rate  
**Constraints**: <10MB startup memory, <50MB peak memory, offline-capable with cache  
**Scale/Scope**: Individual developer workflows, typical 10-50 actions per project

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
