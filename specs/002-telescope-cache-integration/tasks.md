# Tasks: Telescope Integration with Smart Caching

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-telescope-cache-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not explicitly requested in feature specification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Neovim Plugin**: `lua/ghactions/`, `plugin/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths follow the research.md directory structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create plugin directory structure per research.md
- [ ] T002 Initialize Lua plugin with Neovim dependencies in lua/ghactions/init.lua
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure code quality tools (stylua, luacheck) with .stylua.toml
- [ ] T004 [P] Setup testing framework (plenary.nvim) with test structure
- [ ] T005 [P] Configure performance monitoring setup
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup documentation structure with doc/ghactions.txt

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Create plugin registration with lazy loading in plugin/ghactions.lua
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement configuration management in lua/ghactions/config.lua
- [ ] T009 [P] Setup cache directory structure and utilities in lua/ghactions/cache.lua
- [ ] T010 [P] Implement GitHub CLI integration in lua/ghactions/github.lua
- [ ] T011 [P] Create utility functions in lua/ghactions/utils.lua
- [ ] T012 Configure error handling and notification system
- [ ] T013 Setup file type detection for workflow files

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Interactive Version Selection with Telescope (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Provide interactive Telescope picker for browsing and selecting action versions with README preview

**Independent Test**: Open workflow file, invoke :GhActionsVersions, navigate options, verify preview updates and selection works

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Smart Cache Management (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Implement intelligent caching to minimize API calls and enable offline functionality

**Independent Test**: Run picker multiple times, verify cached data used initially, API calls only for stale/missing entries

### Implementation for User Story 2

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Release Information Display (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Display detailed release information including recent releases and README content

**Independent Test**: Verify picker displays correct number of recent releases and README content in preview

### Implementation for User Story 4

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Core picker functionality
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Cache system, integrates with US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - File discovery, integrates with US1
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhanced display, integrates with US1

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Independent testing after each story
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all core components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Telescope picker module in lua/ghactions/picker.lua"
Task: "Implement action reference detection in lua/ghactions/utils.lua"
Task: "Add GitHub API release fetching in lua/ghactions/github.lua"

# Launch picker functionality tasks together:
Task: "Implement README content fetching for preview in lua/ghactions/github.lua"
Task: "Create picker entry transformation logic in lua/ghactions/picker.lua"
Task: "Implement real-time preview updates in lua/ghactions/picker.lua"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Telescope picker)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Cache management)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (File discovery)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Release display)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Total tasks: 64 (including quality assurance)
- MVP scope: Tasks T001-T022 (Setup, Foundational, User Story 1)
- Parallel opportunities: 42 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
