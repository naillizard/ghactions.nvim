# Feature Specification: GitHub Actions Pin/Unpin Commands

**Feature Branch**: `001-gh-actions-pin`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a neovim plugin that exposes 2 commands, one command is used to "Pin" the workflow action versions to the commit sha of the tag, for example, if `uses: actions/checkout@v5, calling the command e.g. :GhActionsSecure, will replace the tag with the equivalent SHA, `uses: actions/checkout@08c6903cd8c0fde910a37f88322edcfb5dd907a8`, the second command :GhActionsUnsecure, reverts the process hence returning the `uses: actions/checkout@v5`, this will require the plugin to be able to call the Github API, so it should detect the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable and use that, but also allow the user to configure the github_token in the setup or opts."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Pin Action Versions (Priority: P1)

As a developer working with GitHub Actions workflows, I want to pin action versions to specific commit SHAs so that my workflows are reproducible and protected from unexpected changes in action updates.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides value by ensuring workflow stability and reproducibility, which is critical for CI/CD pipelines.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a workflow file with action tags, running the pin command, and verifying that tags are replaced with their corresponding commit SHAs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workflow file contains `uses: actions/checkout@v5`, **When** I run `:GhActionsSecure`, **Then** the line is replaced with `uses: actions/checkout@08c6903cd8c0fde910a37f88322edcfb5dd907a8`
2. **Given** a workflow file contains multiple action tags, **When** I run `:GhActionsSecure`, **Then** all tags are replaced with their corresponding commit SHAs
3. **Given** no GITHUB_TOKEN is configured, **When** I run `:GhActionsSecure`, **Then** I see an error message explaining how to configure authentication

### User Story 2 - Unpin Action Versions (Priority: P1)

As a developer maintaining GitHub Actions workflows, I want to unpin action versions back to tags so that I can receive updates and maintain flexibility in my workflow definitions.

**Why this priority**: This provides the reverse functionality, allowing users to easily switch between pinned and unpinned states, making the feature complete and user-friendly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a workflow file with pinned SHAs, running the unpin command, and verifying that SHAs are replaced with their corresponding tags.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workflow file contains `uses: actions/checkout@08c6903cd8c0fde910a37f88322edcfb5dd907a8`, **When** I run `:GhActionsUnsecure`, **Then** the line is replaced with `uses: actions/checkout@v5`
2. **Given** a workflow file contains multiple pinned action SHAs, **When** I run `:GhActionsUnsecure`, **Then** all SHAs are replaced with their corresponding tags
3. **Given** a pinned SHA cannot be resolved to a tag, **When** I run `:GhActionsUnsecure`, **Then** the SHA remains unchanged and a warning is shown

---

### User Story 3 - Configure Authentication (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to configure GitHub authentication through environment variables or plugin configuration so that the plugin can access the GitHub API to resolve action references.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is essential for the core functionality but has reasonable defaults, making it less critical than the main pin/unpin operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting different authentication methods and verifying the plugin successfully authenticates with GitHub API.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set, **When** I use pin/unpin commands, **Then** the plugin uses the token for API calls
2. **Given** no environment variable is set but token is configured in plugin setup, **When** I use pin/unpin commands, **Then** the plugin uses the configured token
3. **Given** no authentication is configured, **When** I use pin/unpin commands, **Then** I receive clear instructions on how to configure authentication

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitHub API rate limits are exceeded?
- How does system handle private repositories that require authentication?
- What happens when an action tag doesn't exist or has been deleted?
- How does system handle malformed action references in workflow files?
- What happens when network connectivity is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
